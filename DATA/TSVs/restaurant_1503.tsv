Ai Do Campanili	via Marco Polo 2	Cavallino	30013	Veneto	Italy	45.4656073	12.4563395	€€€	Seafood	Both the building in which it is housed and the dining room of this restaurant are on the small side, but the quality of the food more than compensates for the lack of space. Run by young and enthusiastic staff, the restaurant specialises in fish and seafood with raw options and modern dishes featuring on the menu. Excellent selection of wine, also available to take away.
