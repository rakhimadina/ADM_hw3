Burro & Alici	lungomare Colombo 98	Marotta	61032	Marche	Italy	43.7665284	13.1445936	€€	Seafood, Classic Cuisine	With just a road separating it from the beach (in summer, the large windows open completely, so that the dining room has the feel of an outdoor terrace), this simple restaurant is similar to the many others dotted along the seafront in Marotta. However, it’s the food that is the main attraction – the colourful, generous cuisine of the Adriatic, with fish served in classic recipes occasionally finished with an imaginative and personal twist. Fish also take pride of place on the delicious gourmet pizzas served here.	['Terrace']	['amex', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 0721 961200	https://www.ristoranteburroealici.it/
