Osteria Altran	Località Cortona 19	Ruda	33050	Friuli-Venezia Giulia	Italy	45.8132892	13.410651	€€€	Italian, Modern Cuisine	A small gourmet restaurant surrounded by the verdant landscapes of the Friuli countryside. In what was once a simple farm, owner Guido Lanzellotti has brought this seemingly rustic yet delightfully romantic restaurant to life, creating modern cuisine that focuses on top-quality ingredients and careful preparation. The lounge-cum-library adorned with cookery books is available for small private events as well as aperitifs and post-dinner drinks. Our inspector recommends the lobster soup and mixed pasta, a dish inspired by a traditional “buzara”-style recipe, with a delicious shellfish jus and al dente pasta. The dish is served with a “smetana” sauce that is very similar to sour cream and is Russian in origin.
