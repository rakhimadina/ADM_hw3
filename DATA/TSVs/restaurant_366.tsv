Contraste	via Giuseppe Meda 2	Milan	20136	Lombardy	Italy	45.446095	9.17929	€€€€	Modern Cuisine, Innovative	Following recent refurbishment, this restaurant in a period building that conjures up an image of old Milan has a bright and colourful feel thanks to its shades of blue, red and green. The courtyard, a small, tranquil space that adds an unexpected touch of greenery to this urban setting, is perfect for a cigar or aperitif. Once inside chef Matias Perdomo’s home, you have a choice between the “Riflesso” menu (traditional dishes yet prepared using modern techniques) and the “Riflessioni” menu (bolder and more innovative options featuring unusual combinations). Contraste’s philosophy lies in the chef’s ability to bring his ingredients to life, using imaginative combinations that delight and appeal to the palate. Overseen with professionalism by an excellent team that will offer recommendations for the best pairings (either wine or non-alcoholic options), the wine list includes a selection of labels from around the world, with a particular focus on France.
