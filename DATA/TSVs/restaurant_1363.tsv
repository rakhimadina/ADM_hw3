Casa Bertini	via le Grazie 7b	Recanati	62019	Marche	Italy	43.40711	13.53811	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Country cooking	This unexpected gourmet restaurant is housed in a sports centre just outside the historic centre of Recanati, birthplace of famous Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi. At the helm in the kitchen, young, talented chef Andrea Bertini has returned to his native region where he reinterprets the traditions of the Marche (especially meat) to create light, simple and unfussy dishes. The same simple style is echoed in the decor, which is elegant and very understated.
