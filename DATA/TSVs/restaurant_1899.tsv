Saporium	località Palazzetto 110	Chiusdino	53012	Tuscany	Italy	43.1414359	11.1278724	€€€€	Tuscan, Italian Contemporary	Saporium is the new fine-dining restaurant at the superb Relais Borgo Santo Pietro, an old property where the internal decor demonstrates a rare elegance, especially in the evening when hundreds of candles provide soft lighting and a romantic ambience in the dining room. In fine weather, meals are served under an elegant 13C portico overlooking the garden, with the property’s 100ha grounds and the Valle Serena as a backdrop. Much of the produce used in the cuisine (designed by executive chef Ariel Hagan and transformed by resident chef Luca Ottogalli into modern, delicate dishes) comes from the hotel’s own olive groves, vineyards, orchards and vegetable gardens. The focus here is on seasonal ingredients from this extraordinary region – the saddle of hare with cavolo nero and pear is a perfect example! A whole host of wine-pairing options are possible thanks to a wine list featuring over 1 300 labels. We recommend trying one of the Borgo’s own wines, such as the harmonious and elegant Pinot Nero.
