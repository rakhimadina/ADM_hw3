Marelet	viale Cesare Battisti 17	Treviglio	24047	Lombardy	Italy	45.5242169	9.5952355	€€	Modern Cuisine, Italian	The name of this restaurant discreetly hidden away in an alleyway on the edge of the town centre is a dialect word meaning “old bachelor”. Small tables set close together give the ambience of a French brasserie and provide the setting for modern, Mediterranean-inspired cuisine. There’s a simpler menu at lunchtime, including salads, tapas and sandwiches, while more choice is available in the evening. Lively atmosphere.
