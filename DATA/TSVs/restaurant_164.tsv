Contrasto	via Roma 55	Cercemaggiore	86012	Molise	Italy	41.4592138	14.7200502	€€	Modern Cuisine, Creative	Having returned to his native village, owner-chef Lucio Testa has opened this restaurant in a former sheepfold on the outskirts of the village perched at an altitude of 937m. The restaurant boasts a perfectly preserved stone façade, various small rooms arranged on different levels, exposed beams and contemporary-style lamps which give the dining room a modern feel. The creative cuisine features reinterpretations of traditional recipes from the Molise, which combine local and seasonal ingredients (including produce from the restaurant’s own kitchen garden) with culinary techniques such as sauces, seasonings and emulsions acquired by the chef from his time working in France. Moulard duck is a favourite ingredient, while various tasting menus and an à la carte showcase the region.
