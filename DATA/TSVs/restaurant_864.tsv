Autem*	via Serviliano Lattuada 2	Milan	20135	Lombardy	Italy	45.4534577	9.2040052	€€€	Farm to table, Modern Cuisine	A modern direction with the kitchen well in view, even from the outside, just a short walk from Porta Romana, in a district buzzing with pubs and restaurants. The engaging initiative of bringing the menus written in the chef’s hand enhances the artisanal work and allows explaining the various dishes in person. This is the cuisine of Luca Natalini, a real Tuscan who loves illustrating his region and the produce he knows best: charcoal-grilled whole pigeon served with an offal tartlet is an excellent example of his culinary skill. A bright room at the entrance and a more private space at the back.	['Air conditioning', 'Wheelchair access']	['amex', 'dinersclub', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 351 278 0368	https://autem-milano.com/
