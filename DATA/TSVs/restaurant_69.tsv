Giglio	piazza del Giglio 2	Lucca	55100	Tuscany	Italy	43.8410854	10.5032438	€€€	Classic Cuisine, Italian	Housed in a beautiful 18C palazzo, Giglio boasts a superb location in one of the many squares in Lucca’s charming historic centre, as well as a delightful outdoor space. The meat and fish dishes on the menu here are inspired by traditional Italian recipes and reinterpreted with a light modern touch – a good example is the siphoned potato which is sprinkled with bottarga and served with a squid sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and spicy parsley cream. The bread is always excellent.	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	['amex', 'dinersclub', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 0583 494058	https://www.ristorantegiglio.com/
