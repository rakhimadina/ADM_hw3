Atman	Via IV Novembre 20	Vinci	50059	Tuscany	Italy	43.7862727	10.9260458	€€€	Creative	The village where the famous Leonardo was born (we highly recommend a visit to the museum dedicated to the artist) is now home to this renowned restaurant right in the village centre. Atman offers just one tasting menu which changes constantly in line with the seasons and market availability, in order to allow chef Marco Cahssai to express his imaginative talents to the full. Among the creations on the interesting new menu, don’t miss the spaghetti with five types of tomato, which demonstrates a play of techniques and is full of flavour – the dish is served cold in order to allow the aromatic seasoning to shine through. Also worth sampling is the glazed pigeon served with plums which emphasise its succulent texture. Make sure you ask for wine-pairing recommendations – the often intense contrasts of the dishes require careful attention to ensure the right balance.
