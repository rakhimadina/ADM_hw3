O Me O Il Mare	Via Roma 45/47	Gragnano	80054	Campania	Italy	40.6916293	14.5157334	€€€€	Italian Contemporary, Modern Cuisine	Known around the world as the town of pasta, Gragnano is still home to small-scale pasta-makers renowned for their top-quality pasta. To reinforce this fact, this restaurant is housed in a building (dating back to 1695) once used as pasta factory. Now boasting a modern, spacious dining room with a vaulted ceiling and open-view kitchen, the restaurant serves three tasting menus, all with strong links to the region but also featuring more creative touches. The region also takes pride of place on the wine list – it’s worth asking the talented and experienced sommelier for her recommendations.
