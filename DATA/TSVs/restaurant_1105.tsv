Here, he pays careful attention to the use of organic produce, creating meat and fish dishes that are inspired by local traditions and prepared in a style that is a combination of classic and modern influences. Desserts remain in the capable hands of his sister Dalila, whose millefeuille is one of her standout dishes.
