The dishes here are colourful, full of flavour and carefully thought out, demonstrating Indonesian influences that recall the chef’s personal and professional experiences in this Asian country. Options include two tasting menus (a good starting point that allow you to appreciate the chef’s creativity to the full) and an à la carte. The excellent wine list is overseen by sommelier Régis Ramos who skilfully assists guests with their choices.
