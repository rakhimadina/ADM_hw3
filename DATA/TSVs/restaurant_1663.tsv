Borgo Poscolle	via Poscolle 21/a	Cavazzo Carnico	33020	Friuli-Venezia Giulia	Italy	46.36565	13.03708	â‚¬	Traditional Cuisine	Home - style cooking with a focus on regional specialities is served in this attractive family - run trattoria, which has its own organic vegetable garden and an educational "pet therapy" farm. The search for ingredients produced as close to home as possible is something of an obsession with the owner - chef, who is also passionate about his desserts. Make sure you try the millefeuille with strawberries and cream.	['Car park', 'Terrace', 'Wheelchair access']	['dinersclub', 'maestrocard', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 366 491 5854	None
