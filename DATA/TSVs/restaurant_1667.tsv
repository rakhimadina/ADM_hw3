Smoked produce and an incredible use of native herbs, bark, lichens and resins feature alongside unique cheeses, intensely flavoured wild game and freshwater fish, while the chef’s creativity and careful research guides his choice of cooking methods. Cuisine from a true artist!	['Interesting wine list']	['amex', 'dinersclub', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 0462 340074	https://www.alessandrogilmozzi.it
