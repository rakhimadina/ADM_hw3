La Rei Natura by Michelangelo Mammoliti	via Roddino 21	Serralunga d'Alba	12050	Piedmont	Italy	44.5942745	8.0002065	€€€€	Creative, Contemporary	At this restaurant, the young yet already experienced Piedmontese chef (who also has Calabrian origins) offers three tasting menus. Dishes are also available à la carte style on two of these – “ Emozioni” (which features creative dishes inspired by childhood memories and flavours) and “Voyage” (ingredients, recipes and influences from the chef’s experience working around the world, including a delicious mango and coconut dessert). The third, Mad100% Natura, is a blind tasting menu on which the chef demonstrates his love and passion for his ingredients with real creativity. Most of his vegetables are sourced from local biodynamic gardens and greenhouses. On our last visit, we particularly enjoyed the courgettes “alla beccafico”, spaghetti with tomato sauce in honour of Nonna Tita, and the vegetable pizza served as a dessert. The high quality of the cuisine is equalled by the impressive selection of wines.
