Dissapore di Andrea Catalano	via Pietro Micca 15	Carovigno	72012	Apulia	Italy	40.7073742	17.6581893	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Apulian	Don’t be put off by the maze of narrow streets leading to this restaurant in the historic town – once you reach your destination, you’ll enjoy delicious classic recipes from Puglia prepared using top-quality ingredients and full of unmistakeable flavours, all served in a charming dining room with lime and stone walls crowned by a domed ceiling. Among the highly recommended dishes, don’t miss the “purely instinctive” scampi with sweet pepper and saffron. Wines from Puglia, elsewhere in Italy and further afield accompany chef Andrea’s eclectic cuisine, while front of house, bubbly and friendly Franca oversees the excellent service. In summer, don’t miss the outdoor terrace overlooking the village rooftops with views of the sea in the distance!
