Porta di Basso	via Colombo 38	Peschici	71010	Apulia	Italy	41.9493778	16.0129423	€€€	Seafood, Contemporary	Owner-chef Domenico Cilenti offers a choice of two tasting menus: one dedicated to classic dishes that tell the story of the restaurant and the other a “blind” menu that changes daily depending on the ingredients available in the market. Whichever you choose, the cuisine served is deliberately simple and precise, allowing the full flavours of Puglia’s vibrant produce to shine through. Each dish consists of just a few ingredients arranged in a colourful and elegant presentation on ad hoc porcelain.
