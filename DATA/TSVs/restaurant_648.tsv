Essenziale	piazza di Cestello 3 r	Florence	50124	Tuscany	Italy	43.7703309	11.2435173	€€	Modern Cuisine	As its name suggests, this restaurant (once a garage) on Piazza di Cestello has a young, minimalist ambience. The welcome and service here are friendly, while the cuisine is never ordinary, offering combinations that are pleasantly contrasting without being too bold. The chef, who is originally from Livorno, is particularly adept at creating fish and seafood dishes. You’ll find your cutlery in a drawer in your table, in an interesting nod to household traditions of bygone days.
