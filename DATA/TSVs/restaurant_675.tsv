Il Giurista	via Bartolo 30	Perugia	06122	Umbria	Italy	43.113269	12.38963	€€	Regional Cuisine, Classic Cuisine	This restaurant is named after Bartolo da Sassoferrato (as is the street on which it stands), a distinguished 14C jurist. From the street, you head down a few steps to the welcoming dining rooms with their historic ambience and brick-vaulted ceilings that keep the temperature pleasantly cool. The cuisine, which focuses exclusively on meat, is traditional and regional in flavour – an entire section of the menu is dedicated to black truffles in season. Friendly and attentive service.
