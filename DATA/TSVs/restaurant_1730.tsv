Indiniò	via Norsinia 21/b	Raveo	33029	Friuli-Venezia Giulia	Italy	46.4343104	12.8697139	€€	Italian Contemporary, Regional Cuisine	This restaurant (the name Indiniò means “nowhere” in old Carnian dialect) is run by an enthusiastic female owner-chef who left her former job to realise her dream: namely, to create personalised cuisine of the highest quality with ingredients from her local region and elsewhere, while her partner takes charge of the dining room. Indiniò is both welcoming and elegant, with just a few tables, an intimate ambience and a small space for more private dining.
