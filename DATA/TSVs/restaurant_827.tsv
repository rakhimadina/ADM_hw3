Gina	via Croce di Città 25	Aosta	11100	Aosta Valley	Italy	45.7367641	7.3167877	€€€	Modern Cuisine	In the old town, a simple and informal location (but on the floor below there are two rooms between the Roman walls of Aosta!) for a cuisine of remarkable quality: the chef often starts from local traditions to develop them into more creative dishes, whose protagonists are often mountain products.
