La Parolina	via Giacomo Leopardi 1	Trevinano	01021	Lazio	Italy	42.8218494	11.8692538	€€€€	Country cooking, Modern Cuisine	Although La Parolina is situated in Lazio, chefs Iside and Romano bring together the influences of three neighbouring regions in their simply prepared dishes, namely Lazio, Tuscany (the beautiful rolling hills of which can be admired from the restaurant’s summer terrace) and Umbria. Ingredients include mushrooms from Monte Amiata, truffles from the Sienese hills, asparagus from Canino and hazelnuts from Monti Cimini, as well as vegetables from Umbria and fish from the nearby Lake Bolsena and the Tyrrhenian Sea. Partners in life as well as in the kitchen, these two chefs skilfully balance local traditions with more modern influences. A few guestrooms are available at the restaurant’s La Letterina.
