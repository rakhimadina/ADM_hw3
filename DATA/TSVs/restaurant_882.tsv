Brezza fish and chill	Via Marina 24	Soverato	88068	Calabria	Italy	38.690953	16.5465149	€	Seafood, Fish and Chips	An alternative eatery amid the Abruzzo dining options, situated on the beautiful seafront promenade at Soverato. The idea is simple: fish takes centre stage, served in rolls, on "broast" and “friselle” bread, as well as raw or fried, although generous salads and delicious desserts are also available. The ingredients, full of flavour and always simply prepared, result in copious and colourful dishes. Good quality wine is available by the glass, plus a fine choice of cocktails which is enhanced in the evening by the addition of creative home-made options. Friendly female staff, plus excellent background music. A pleasant address serving quality food at very reasonable prices!
