Da Odino	via Roma 87	Quarto d'Altino	30020	Veneto	Italy	45.5843	12.35232	€€	Seafood, Venetian	This restaurant has stood on this square for many years, having been built as a “casone” and previously used as a dance hall. Despite its large size, the atmosphere is pleasant and convivial, helped by the staff here who are friendly yet professional. Situated just a stone’s throw from the Park Hotel Junior, a modern hotel under the same ownership, the restaurant specialises in fish and seafood, although you’ll also find meat and vegetarian options on the menu.
