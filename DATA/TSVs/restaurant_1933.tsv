Nin	via Zanardelli 5	Brenzone sul Garda	37010	Veneto	Italy	45.7154863	10.7716421	€€€€	Creative	Chef Terry Giacomello has taken inspiration from his travels around the world to create his NIN menu, while his CLASSICI option focuses on Italian favourites. His cuisine features a combination of modern techniques and classic influences, with an added dose of creativity and innovation. Although the first-floor dining room overlooks Lake Garda, only a fortunate few will have a table with a view, so booking in advance is recommended!
