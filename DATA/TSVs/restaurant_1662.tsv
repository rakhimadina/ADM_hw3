Badessa	via Case Secchia 2	Casalgrande	42013	Emilia-Romagna	Italy	44.6255198	10.7485293	€€	Emilian	This restaurant has a surprising location in a 19C cheese factory which once produced parmesan cheese. Although the purpose of the building has changed, the love of the region remains the same: the chef goes out of his way to source local ingredients and serve traditional Emilian dishes, often with a modern twist. One of the best restaurants in rural Reggio Emilia.	['Air conditioning', 'Car park', 'Terrace']	['amex', 'maestrocard', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 0522 989138	https://www.ristorantebadessa.it/
