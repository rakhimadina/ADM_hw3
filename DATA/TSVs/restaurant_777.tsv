Romani	via dei Ronchi 2	Vicomero di Torrile	43056	Emilia-Romagna	Italy	44.8839459	10.3150109	€	Emilian	This restaurant has a traditional feel, both in its richly decorated dining room and in its cuisine, the roots of which are firmly planted in the region. This is the place for guests who aren’t keen on reinterpreted dishes or exotic fare but prefer the classic flavours of Parma such as cured hams, fresh pasta, and roast and grilled meat, all served in a typical country farmhouse.
