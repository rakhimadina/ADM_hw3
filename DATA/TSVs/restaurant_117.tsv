San Martino	piazza Cappelletto 1, località Rio San Martino	Scorzè	30037	Veneto	Italy	45.5892243	12.110501	€€€	Modern Cuisine	A smart, elegant restaurant with a bright, minimalist decor in which large tables are well spaced out to create an exclusive feel. The chef’s wife brings a touch of friendly informality to the restaurant, along with an impressive knowledge of the excellent wine list, which offers a wide array of sparkling wines and champagnes. The cuisine here is modern and personalised, with a slight emphasis on fish, although meat dishes also feature.
