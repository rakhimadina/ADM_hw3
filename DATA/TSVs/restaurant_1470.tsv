Il Saraceno	piazza Don Verdelli 2	Cavernago	24050	Lombardy	Italy	45.6304009	9.7650842	€€€€	Mediterranean Cuisine, Modern Cuisine	The chef’s Amalfi origins re-emerge in great style in this restaurant at the gates of Bergamo, with a chiefly seafood cuisine of great quality. From raw seafood to spaghetti with sea urchins and breadcrumbs, from seabream to the fish of the day, it is a feast for the palate, culminating in the desserts. The quality of the leavened products is noteworthy, from bread to focaccia with oregano and cherry tomatoes. The wine list is good too, starting with the selection of Champagnes.
