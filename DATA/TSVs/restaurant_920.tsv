Vite	viale della Repubblica 3	Lancenigo	31020	Veneto	Italy	45.6981936	12.2575026	€€€	Contemporary, Creative	Make sure you take a look at the two dining rooms at this restaurant, both of which are striking for their contemporary design, individual character (they are very different from each other) and beautiful furnishings. In the kitchen, Leoluca Brambilla prepares two tasting menus which are fundamentally creative yet at the same time influenced by the region, featuring fish and seafood (especially from the Venetian lagoon) and meat from the inland Marca Trevigiana area.
