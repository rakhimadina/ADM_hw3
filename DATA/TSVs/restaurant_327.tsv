And that’s not all – Durnwald is an excellent place to appreciate the Alto Adige, both in terms of its landscapes, which can be admired from the dining room windows, and its cuisine, which keeps alive the genuine traditions of the region. Specialities include Valle Aurina cheese with pumpkin seed oil, and sfoglie di patate (potato fritters) with sauerkraut, sausage and mustard sauce.
