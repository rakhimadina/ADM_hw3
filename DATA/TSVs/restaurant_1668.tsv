Già Sotto l'Arco	corso Vittorio Emanuele 71	Carovigno	72012	Apulia	Italy	40.7071485	17.6590721	€€€€	Italian, Creative	A historic gourmet restaurant, with an equally historic setting on the first floor of a Baroque palazzo fronting an elegant piazza. A fine staircase leads up to the simple yet stylish dining room, which is skilfully run by a father and his offspring. In the kitchen, his wife Teresa prepares creative, regional cuisine, which is showcased on a surprise menu of four, six or eight courses and which features locally sourced meat and fish. If you’d like to book the delightful table on the small terrace for just two fortunate guests, make sure you do so well in advance!
