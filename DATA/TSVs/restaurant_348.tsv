Il Michelaccio	via Frugoni 49 r	Genoa	16121	Liguria	Italy	44.4035	8.939671	€€	Traditional Cuisine, Farm to table	A veritable bistro in a modern style and in a central position, a short distance from the famous Via XX Settembre, where the chef patron turns his hand to a fragrant cuisine, from the market, often dedicated to the Ligurian tradition (cream of potato with Genoese sea snails), but opening up to Italian flavors (pappa al pomodoro and burratina). He sometimes allows himself an imaginative touch, as in the risotto with anchovies and raspberries. Only natural wines.
