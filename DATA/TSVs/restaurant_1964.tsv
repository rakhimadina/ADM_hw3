Ristorante de LEN	Via Cesare Battisti 66	Cortina d'Ampezzo	32043	Veneto	Italy	46.53884	12.13403	€€	Regional Cuisine	Just a stone’s throw from the central and very busy Corso Italia, this restaurant has an elegant Alpine feel. Here, subtle lighting, soft background music and larch wood cladding on the walls create an ambience with an attractive blend of the modern and traditional. The cuisine takes inspiration from the local region, with specialities interpreted with a contemporary twist, including a focus on vegetable- and cheese-based dishes such as the excellent “fonduta di Saporito d'alpeggio” (fondue).
