Ca' Matilde	via Polita 14	Rubbianino	42020	Emilia-Romagna	Italy	44.652336	10.52569	€€€€	Italian Contemporary	Surrounded by verdant landscapes, this attractive restaurant with a pleasant outdoor dining space is functional in style, due to the use of simple materials such as wrought iron and wood, and as such boasts a distinctly minimalist feel. A continual quest for cuisine that is both contemporary and rustic in flavour is reflected in owner-chef Vezzani’s respectful reinterpretations of local recipes, which are clearly influenced by tradition. The restaurant offers four surprise tasting menus: “Gli intramontabili” (often with pairings of the region’s best Lambrusco wines); “Acqua in bocca”; “Con i piedi per terra”; and “Cielo”, all of which demonstrate a playful use of flavours and combinations with a keen focus on seasonal ingredients.
