Da Lucio	viale Ortigara 80	Rimini	47921	Emilia-Romagna	Italy	44.0782307	12.5696634	€€€	Seafood, Contemporary	This restaurant boasts an impressive setting on the end of a jetty surrounded by the sea in Rimini docks. The entrance stands next to the open-view kitchen (a spectacle in itself!), which then leads into the long dining room. Nearly all the fish here (which comes from the Adriatic) is aged to allow water to evaporate so that the flavours are concentrated; it is then grilled or baked in a wood-fired oven, as well as served raw, with surprising and remarkable results.
