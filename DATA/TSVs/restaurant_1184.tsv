Gagini Restaurant	via dei Cassari 35	Palermo	90133	Sicily	Italy	38.1184687	13.3661866	€€€	Creative, Contemporary	Situated in the lively heart of Palermo between the Vucciria and the small Cala port, this restaurant boasts a modern design and bold colours which are all the more striking for the charming old building which it occupies, the 16C studio of sculptor Antonello Gagini (hence the restaurant name!). Here, Italian-Brazilian chef Mauricio Zillo serves highly personal cuisine which is rich in contrasting flavours and prepared using Sicilian ingredients (even when exotic ingredients such as papaya appear on the menu, they are sourced from Sicily). The service is attentive yet with an informal touch that puts guests at their ease.
