LeoneFelice Vista Lago	via Vittorio Emanuele 23	Erbusco	25030	Lombardy	Italy	45.6017335	9.9744178	€€€	Italian, Contemporary	The new chef at this restaurant focuses on highlighting produce grown in the property’s own kitchen garden, as well as meat from the farm in the Grosseto area that is also run by the Andana estate. The classic-style cuisine on the à la carte features occasional personalised touches (for example, aubergines baked in fig leaf with oregano, and perch or sea bass fillet served with coloured beets and soft potato), while in the evening a tasting menu is served in a dedicated part of the restaurant. The expertly explained wine list focuses on the estate’s own labels and the Franciacorta region in general, yet at the same time includes a selection of wines from elsewhere in Italy and further afield.
