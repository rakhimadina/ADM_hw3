Various culinary options feature on the menu, including meat, fish and vegetarian dishes, all colourful, full of flavour and beautifully cooked and prepared using mainly local and seasonal ingredients. The well-stocked and carefully chosen wine list deserves a special mention: among the 1 000 or more bottles stored in the old giasàra (underground cellar), you’re sure to find something you’ll enjoy.
