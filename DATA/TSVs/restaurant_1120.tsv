Zur Rose	via Josef Innerhofer 2	San Michele	39057	Trentino-South Tyrol	Italy	46.455093	11.258857	€€€	Regional Cuisine, Classic Cuisine	The long-established Zur Rose is a gourmet restaurant that has certainly made its mark along the romantic Tyrolean Wine Route. Here, chef Herbert Hintner serves his own version of creative, contemporary cuisine (ably assisted for the past five years by his son Daniel) which has a strong regional identity influenced by the Alto Adige, in an elegant building dating back to 1300 – the restaurant has been known as “La Rosa” since 1585. Ingredients and dishes change depending on the time of year, with two menus each season, one regional, the other vegetarian. Riding the crest of a wave for decades, Hintner’s cuisine never falters and continues to offer an unmissable gourmet experience.
