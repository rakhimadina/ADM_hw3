Canova by Sadler	sestiere San Marco 1243	Venice	30124	Veneto	Italy	45.43326	12.33718	€€€€	Contemporary	The partnership between chef Sadler and the Baglioni chain can now be experienced in Venice, at this restaurant occupying a quiet, intimate dining room with an open-view kitchen in an elegant hotel literally a stone’s throw from St Mark’s Square. Here, the gourmet cuisine is prepared by a trusted resident chef from Puglia who creates visually impressive dishes from carefully chosen ingredients, with a choice of à la carte and two tasting menus (one creative Venetian, the other vegetarian). Simpler fare is available in the bistro next door or at tables on the outdoor terrace in fine weather.
