Hostaria dai Musi	Piazza Michele Ferrero 4/d	Alba	12051	Piedmont	Italy	44.696673	8.0338445	€€	Piedmontese, Seafood	Offering a limited à la carte that includes fish dishes (including raw options) which vary according to market availability, this restaurant serves what it describes as “typically modern cuisine”. The breaded and fried anchovies with a typical saor sauce and lemon gel are particularly good, plus the menu features a selection of typical regional specialities. The pleasant setting is enhanced by the backdrop of the large central square in a pedestrianised area on the edge of the old town. The drinks menu includes an excellent selection of wines, plus a good choice of local beers.
