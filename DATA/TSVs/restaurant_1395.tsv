It boasts a modern, elegant decor, friendly staff and a menu featuring carefully prepared fresh, seasonal dishes. Our inspector particularly recommends the seafood risotto. A choice of regional wines completes the picture.	['Air conditioning']	['amex', 'dinersclub', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 079 207 4486	None
