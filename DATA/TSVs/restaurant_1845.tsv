L'Atelier 26	località Gerandin 26	Saint-Christophe	11020	Aosta Valley	Italy	45.7434008	7.3504867	€€	French, Traditional Cuisine	Situated in a secluded location, this small gem of a restaurant boasts a skilfully restored stone dining room with a welcoming feel. The menu here has a clear French influence evident in both the style of its dishes and ingredients used. Our inspectors particularly recommend the young chef’s iconic snails and duck breast dishes.
