Oberraindlhof	Raindl 49	Madonna di Senales	39020	Trentino-South Tyrol	Italy	46.7144175	10.8830095	€€	Traditional Cuisine, Regional Cuisine	The family that run this restaurant occupying an old farmhouse with origins dating back to the 16C has a relationship with the region that goes back decades. In later years, the farm became an inn and it has now been run by the same family for five generations, all motivated by a desire to introduce their guests to the best recipes and ingredients from the Senales valley. Dishes include an excellent roast lamb (raised on the restaurant’s own farm), which is stewed with bones and potatoes and served at the table from a copper cauldron. An excellent wine list and the hotel’s warm and friendly ambience add to the appeal.
