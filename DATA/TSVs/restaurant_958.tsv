Piazza dei Mestieri	via Jacopo Durandi 13	Turin	10144	Piedmont	Italy	45.081818	7.659965	€€	Modern Cuisine, Piedmontese	Situated on a redeveloped industrial site and part of a training school, this restaurant offers a more concise menu at lunchtime with lower prices than the evening, but with the same high-quality cuisine. Our inspector recommends the spaghetti with spring onion and bottarga, accompanied by one of the craft beers produced on site. There’s also an attractive terrace for alfresco dining in fine weather.
