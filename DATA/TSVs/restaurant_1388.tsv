His dishes are creative and enticing, delicious and at the same time elegant – he manages to find the perfect balance between the fragrant flavours of Mediterranean cuisine and the precision of French technique. His dishes are showcased on three tasting menus, one of which is vegetarian, from which courses can be chosen individually à la carte style. The wine list is also excellent, proudly highlighting labels from Tuscany while at the same time including a selection of French options.
