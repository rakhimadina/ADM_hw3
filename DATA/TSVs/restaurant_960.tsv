Wicky's Innovative Japanese Cuisine	corso Italia 6	Milan	20122	Lombardy	Italy	45.4598093	9.1879947	€€€	Japanese, Asian Contemporary	Although the contemporary, minimalist-style decor is typical of Japanese restaurants, the cuisine will come as more of a surprise, with its magical blend of classic Japanese dishes made from Mediterranean ingredients, beautifully presented and full of flavour. There are two dining rooms: one overlooking the road, and the other with an open-view kitchen and sushi bar, where the chef serves an evening tasting menu for guests happy to put their faith in his imaginative improvisational skills.
