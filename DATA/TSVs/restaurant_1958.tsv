Suscettibile Salerno	via dei Principati 45	Salerno	84122	Campania	Italy	40.6788381	14.7661808	€€€	Country cooking, Contemporary	Separated from a street in the centre of Salerno by an inner courtyard, this restaurant is a peaceful oasis with comfortable chairs arranged on a modern and stylish veranda (which opens almost completely in summer) and in an equally elegant dining room. Young chef Mario Quarta (born in Battipaglia) combines influences from his native region with techniques learned in renowned restaurants elsewhere in Italy and abroad, including Michelin-starred addresses. The French influence evident in his cooking techniques makes his Campania-focused cuisine even more exciting and contemporary. Our inspector particularly enjoyed the “Rombo R-otto” – four mouthwatering textures of meaty turbot served in a beautifully presented dish. Elegant, professional service overseen by manager Marco Sesso completes the picture.
