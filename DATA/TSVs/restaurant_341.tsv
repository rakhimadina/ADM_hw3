Acquerello	via Patrioti 5	Fagnano Olona	21054	Lombardy	Italy	45.6691814	8.8709213	€€€€	Creative	The word “modern” sums up the cuisine here, although more than one word is needed to do justice to this restaurant. Housed in an old courtyard typical of Lombardy, Acquerello focuses on flavour rather than colour, with dishes created by a chef who enjoys being in the kitchen away from the spotlight. Although the restaurant offers an à la carte, our inspectors recommend the tasting menu with its fine balance of delicate flavours and original combinations that offer a hint of Eastern influence and pleasing contrasts in cooking methods and temperatures. The wine selection reflects the owner’s tastes: a slight emphasis on sparkling wines from the other side of the Alps, but also something for everyone.
