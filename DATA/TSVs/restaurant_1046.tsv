Delicato	via Umberto I 2	Contigliano	02043	Lazio	Italy	42.4092142	12.7659505	€€	Country cooking	Situated in a picturesque medieval hilltop village in the province of Rieti on the border with Umbria, this restaurant serves cuisine that is influenced by different regions and traditions. Choose between the minimalist-style dining rooms with exposed stone walls and, in fine weather, a charming outdoor space at the foot of Contigliano’s church. Here, chef Carlotta Delicato brings out the best of local ingredients in dishes that are kept deliberately simple and unfussy yet are full of flavour. We highly recommend the “spaghettone mare e lago” with a light brunoise of courgettes. As the restaurant is situated in Lazio, guests can enjoy good local wines made by small-scale producers, such as the Cabernet Sauvignon Masseria Baroni, which is of medium intensity with broad and pronounced aromas. .
