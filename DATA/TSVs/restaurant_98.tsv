Salvo Cacciatori	via Vieusseux 12	Oneglia	18100	Liguria	Italy	43.89001	8.040223	€€€	Ligurian, Contemporary	This restaurant has come a long way since 1906, when the owner’s ancestors opened a modern inn and wine tavern, evolving into an inviting restaurant with an elegant, contemporary-style decor. The cuisine focuses on traditional fish and seafood recipes reinterpreted with a personalised twist, while the impressive wine list features labels from Liguria and beyond. If you want to eat on the pleasant outdoor terrace overlooking the pedestrianised street it’s best to book ahead.
