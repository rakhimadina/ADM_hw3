Acqua	via Filippo Corridoni 1	Olgiate Olona	21057	Lombardy	Italy	45.6346559	8.8878287	€€€	Seafood, Contemporary	The Possoni continue with their family tradition in this contemporary-style restaurant situated opposite the long-established Ma.Ri.Na. Here, their emphasis is on the quality of ingredients, which is always of paramount importance to chef Menoncin and owner Davide Possoni, who at the beginning of the evening will accompany you to your table and advise you on your choices from the menu. Fish and seafood take centre stage here, showcased in simple, traditional dishes and more complex and creative recipes alike. The menu always features a few raw options, such as the trio of shellfish (scampi, red prawns and what must surely be the largest shrimps you’ve even seen), each of which is served with its own creative and delicate dressing. The wine list includes a number of labels from the Champagne region, plus numerous wines available by the glass. An attractive outdoor space completes the picture.
