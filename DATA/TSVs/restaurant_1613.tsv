Osteria Ophis	corso Serpente Aureo 54/b	Offida	63073	Marche	Italy	42.9355659	13.6924987	€€	Cuisine from the Marches, Modern Cuisine	Situated in the beautiful historic pedestrianised centre of Offida, this restaurant with a brick-vaulted ceiling is housed in the former stables of an old palazzo with a modern, inviting and intimate feel. Here, owner-chef Daniele Citeroni Maurizi skilfully reinterprets regional cuisine to create precise, imaginative dishes that are full of flavour. The stuffed cannelloni cooked on the barbecue grill are delicious, as is the veal tartare served with a warm meat, herb and vegetable jus on the side. We should also highlight the “low cost” tasting menu available for guests aged under 25.	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	['amex', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 0736 889920	https://www.osteriaophis.com/
