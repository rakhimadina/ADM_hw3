Aqua	lungolago Conca d'Oro 11	Torbole	38069	Trentino-South Tyrol	Italy	45.8682988	10.8769404	€€	Italian Contemporary, Italian	The most attractive space in this restaurant is its contemporary, almost Milanese-style veranda-dining room which boasts relaxing views of Lake Garda, with sailboats bobbing on the water ruffled by the famous Ora wind, and the peaks of Trentino in the distance. The Italian cuisine served here is prepared simply, allowing the quality of the ingredients (many of which are sourced locally) to shine through. Fish from the lake takes pride of place, although saltwater fish also features. There’s also a good selection of wine.
