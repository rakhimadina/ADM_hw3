Villa Pizzini	Località Mottarone	Stresa	28838	Piedmont	Italy	45.8768	8.4586	€€€	Country cooking, Modern Cuisine	From Lake Maggiore you climb up Mottarone mountain to an altitude of around 1 400m to reach this 19C hunting lodge, where a young couple of self-taught chefs provide a warm and friendly welcome. The cuisine here speaks for itself – delicious meat dishes, plus a few specialities from the lake which are also served outdoors to a backdrop of stunning views. This couple are passionate about using seasonal ingredients and learning about every different stage in their supply chain. Local game dishes are highly recommended.
