Locanda San Martino	via Don Ermolao Barattin 23	Chies d'Alpago	32010	Veneto	Italy	46.1816792	12.3923716	€€	Venetian, Seasonal Cuisine	Founded in 1952, this inn has been run by the same family – and especially its female members – ever since. It now boasts the presence of a chef whose many years of experience are evident in his dishes. Much of the meat (especially lamb) is raised in the restaurant’s own farm nearby, while the dishes on the menu are seasonal and classic in style yet with a hint of modern flavour. When the weather allows, make the most of the large terrace boasting fine views of the sunset over the surrounding Alpago region.
