San Martino	viale Cesare Battisti 3	Treviglio	24047	Lombardy	Italy	45.5241033	9.5937071	€€€	Seafood	One of the best restaurants in the area, San Martino focuses on fish dishes including classic favourites inherited from the chef’s father as well as more creative fare introduced by the new generation. The Colleoni family never fails to impress! Our inspectors particularly appreciated the constant search for perfection demonstrated by owner-chef Vittorio. This perfection is also evident in the private kitchen garden where flowers and vegetables are grown, emphasising the importance that this chef places on the provenance of his ingredients. The chef’s brother Paolo is responsible for the wine list, which is extensive and well structured, with a slight preference for French labels.
