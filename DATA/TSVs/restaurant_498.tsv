Stube Hermitage	via Castelletto Inferiore 69	Madonna di Campiglio	38086	Trentino-South Tyrol	Italy	46.2131692	10.8244764	€€€€	Creative, Regional Cuisine	Situated in a tranquil and secluded location, this restaurant occupies an early-19C Stube-style dining room in the Biohotel Hermitage. Decorated with a profusion of wood and home to just a few tables, the setting is perfect for a romantic evening with a focus on fine dining. During the 2022-23 winter season, young Antonio Lepore (the former sous-chef here) took over the reins in the kitchen, where he now feels free to explore new ideas and fully express his personality on various tasting menus. Elegance is the key word here, both in the ambience and the cuisine. The excellent selection of cheeses is also worthy of note.
