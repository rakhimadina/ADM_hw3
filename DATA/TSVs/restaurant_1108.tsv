Cile's	viale Cesare Battisti 35	Fano	61032	Marche	Italy	43.8463162	13.0239803	€€	Seafood, Classic Cuisine	Situated near the sea, this small, bright restaurant with an almost shabby feel has a decor featuring plenty of wood, along with a blue and white colour scheme that makes it feel like a corner of Provence in the heart of Fano. The cuisine, however, remains firmly rooted in the local region with simple, very reasonably priced fish dishes and specialities from the Marche. An amusing, imaginative touch comes in the names given to these dishes, such as “Ma che fritto fa...” and “Si salvia chi può”. The graceful and smiling service from the all-female team is an added bonus.	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	['amex', 'dinersclub', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 0721 803390	http://www.ristoranteciles.it
