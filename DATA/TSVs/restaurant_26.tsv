Il Luogo Aimo e Nadia	via Montecuccoli 6	Milan	20147	Lombardy	Italy	45.458435	9.130776	€€€€	Italian Contemporary, Modern Cuisine	This restaurant has been part of the Milanese culinary scene for over 60 years and continues to attract food-lovers in search of top-quality cuisine today. It serves two tasting menus that showcase Italian cuisine in modern dishes, some inspired by the origins of the two chefs, Alessandro Negrini and Fabio Pisani (the former from Lombardy, the latter from Puglia). Make sure you allow plenty of time to peruse the extensive wine list which is displayed on a tablet and includes some hard-to-find labels. The service is courteous and attentive throughout.
