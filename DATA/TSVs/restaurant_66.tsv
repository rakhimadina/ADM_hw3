Enrico Bartolini al Mudec	via Tortona 56	Milan	20144	Lombardy	Italy	45.4516	9.161865	€€€€	Creative	Having received three stars for this restaurant (his flagship address in Milan), Enrico Bartolini has no intention of resting on his laurels. Assisted by resident chef Davide Boglioli, he continues to create new yet approachable dishes full of intense flavours and a variety of influences, so simply sit back and enjoy the perfectly balanced results. There are two tasting menus served here: “Mudec Experience” and the “Best of”, the latter showcasing the chef’s classic favourites. Dishes can be chosen à la carte style from both menus. If you’d like to taste cold spaghetti, leave room for one of the five dishes served on the “creative cheeses” menu that features interesting and unusual combinations. Situated on the third floor of Milan’s Museo delle Culture (Mudec), the restaurant has an elegant and contemporary lounge-style vibe.
