Antica Trattoria la Grotta dal 1918	via Tignano 3, Loc. Mongardino Grotta	Sasso Marconi	40037	Emilia-Romagna	Italy	44.4181181	11.2115002	€	Emilian, Country cooking	It takes a while to get here, along a road which wends its way through the hills, but the cuisine more than compensates for the journey. The food here is based on a careful choice of ingredients (including produce from the restaurant’s own farm) from as far away as the Apennines, with a few ingredients from elsewhere in Italy, with a focus on traditional recipes. Don’t miss the tortellini in brodo, or the game and truffles available in season.
