Young chef Giada Miori prepares regional ingredients with skill and precision, serving specialities such as traditional potato fritters and “carne salada” (salted meat) preserved by the restaurant itself, as well as char, meat from the Trentino region and mushrooms. The Miori family also grow their own red berries, which often make an appearance in their desserts, along with their own sweet chestnuts.
