D.One Restaurant	via del Borgo 1	Montepagano	64026	Abruzzo	Italy	42.6772065	13.9897625	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Country cooking	The location of this restaurant is certainly unique, with its different spaces (including small dining rooms adorned with modern works of art) for different parts of your meal – almost like a small village within a village. Here, chef Davide Pezzuto blends simplicity with creative experimentation, focusing on the region and its culinary traditions while also including the occasional influence from his native Puglia. He is ably supported front of house by the restaurant owner, who regales guests with interesting stories about the small town’s past. At the end of dinner, guests can order an excellent Turkish coffee, which is made according to an original recipe borrowed from the museum, and which highlights the Saracen dominance of the region around a thousand years ago.
