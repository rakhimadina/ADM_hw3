Il Marchese - Osteria Mercato Liquori	via dei Bossi 3	Milan	20121	Lombardy	Italy	45.4675105	9.1865103	€€€	Roman, Italian	Boasting a sumptuous Art Deco setting that contrasts pleasingly with the traditional cuisine served here, this restaurant is the Milanese sibling of Il Marchese in Rome which pays tribute to the famous Italian film “Il Marchese del Grillo” starring Alberto Sordi (it is also the first bar in Europe to offer more than 600 “amaro” liqueurs). The culinary philosophy here is based on traditional Roman cuisine with a contemporary flavour, including delicious specialities such as pasta with carbonara, matriciana and gricia sauces, veal saltimbocca, pork belly and much more besides!
