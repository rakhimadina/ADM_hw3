Contrada Bricconi	via Bricconi 3	Oltressenda Alta	24020	Lombardy	Italy	45.922027	9.9503694	€€€€	Country cooking, Modern Cuisine	Leaving the Val Seriana, you follow a winding road uphill to get to this small stone hamlet dating back to the 15C, with its breathtaking views. Here, a group of young friends have brought this isolated corner of the mountains back to life, reviving old traditions and using a system of crop cultivation and livestock farming that focuses on quality and animal welfare. Young chef Michele Lazzarini has the same sustainable approach in the kitchen, offering an extraordinary gastronomic interpretation of his native mountainous region on an extensive and exciting tasting menu.
