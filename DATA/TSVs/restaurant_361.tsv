House specialities include gnocchi with sheep’s ricotta cheese and hazel butter (the butter isn’t actually made with hazelnuts but is simply melted), and confit pork ribs in beer. The mountain - style decor continues in the simple guestrooms.	['Terrace']	['mastercard', 'visa']	+39 045 783 5566	https://www.13comuni.it/it/
