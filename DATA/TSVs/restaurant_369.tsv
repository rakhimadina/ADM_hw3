InGalera	via Cristina Belgioioso 120	Milan	20157	Lombardy	Italy	45.522552	9.101541	€€	Classic Cuisine, Italian	Thanks to its location inside Bollate prison, InGalera offers a unique dining experience. Here, guests eat in a room within the prison itself, while dishes – of equal quality to other restaurants in the area – are prepared with the contribution of prison inmates. In this subdued ambience, choose from meat and fish dishes, with a restricted choice at lunchtime and the option of ordering a single dish.
