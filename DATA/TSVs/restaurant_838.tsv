Soprattutto	via Noalese 124	Santa Maria di Sala	30036	Veneto	Italy	45.5074704	12.0307818	€€	Seafood, Classic Cuisine	This tiny, welcoming restaurant with a bright, simple decor has long since come of age, having been opened and run by the same family for years. The wife supervises the front of house, while the husband (whose past experience includes working as a metalworker as well as a chef) is at the helm in the kitchen, where he creates classic fish dishes which are full of flavour and simply prepared from top-quality ingredients. As the restaurant is very popular with its regular clientele, booking in advance is essential – you won’t be disappointed!	['Terrace']	['mastercard', 'visa']	+39 041 576 0404	None
