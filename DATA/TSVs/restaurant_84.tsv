Ansitz Steinbock	via Defregger 14	Villandro	39040	Trentino-South Tyrol	Italy	46.6323382	11.5403732	€€€	Creative, Modern Cuisine	Following recent renovation work, this beautiful castle has an even more romantic atmosphere than ever. The restaurant is typical of the Alto Adige, boasting traditional Stube-style rooms that are furnished with a profusion of wood, from the floors to the walls and ceilings. The menu is more varied than previously, with a classic à la carte available for lunch and dinner, while fine-dining options are only available in the evening. The latter are presented on two tasting menus – “Roots” (dedicated to the local region) and “Creativo” (which includes ingredients from elsewhere) – both of which are striking for their imaginative approach.
