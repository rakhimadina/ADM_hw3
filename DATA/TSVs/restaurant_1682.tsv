Antinè	via Torino 16	Barbaresco	12050	Piedmont	Italy	44.725571	8.080728	€€	Piedmontese	Manuel Bouchard’s cuisine impressed our inspectors thanks to striking features such as his minimalist approach and the use of just a few well-chosen ingredients. Traditional recipes, such as plin pasta and Fassona beef, feature on the menu alongside more alternative, imaginative dishes (including fresh- and saltwater fish). This elegant restaurant is located on the first floor of a building in the old town, just a stone’s throw from the medieval tower. A warm welcome and an excellent wine list complete the picture.
