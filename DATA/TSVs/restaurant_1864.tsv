Ai Burattini	via Madaschi 45	Adrara San Martino	24060	Lombardy	Italy	45.6996073	9.9481459	€€	Country cooking	This restaurant just a few kilometres from Lake Iseo is one of the best addresses in the region for local cuisine, featuring fish from the lake and local meat dishes. One meal here is not enough given all the tempting dishes on the menu, including Bergamo-style mutton, dried sardines and trout from the lake, meatballs, home-made casoncelli (stuffed pasta) and the delicious baked rabbit served with Rovetta polenta. As well as the desserts, there’s also a good selection of local cheeses.	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	['mastercard', 'visa']	+39 035 933433	https://www.aiburattini.it
