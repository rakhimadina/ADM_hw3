L'A Gourmet L'Accademia	via Largo C. Colombo 6	Reggio Calabria	89125	Calabria	Italy	38.1139931	15.6505925	€€	Seafood, Modern Cuisine	From the classic restaurant on the first floor (no lift) of this early 20C palazzo, you’ll enjoy fine views of the sea and the Strait of Messina. Here, skilled chef Filippo Cogliardo prepares fish-based dishes which include classic recipes (raw seafood and amberjack with rapini) as well as more modern options (cuttlefish tagliatelle with avocado cream, cucumber and salted lemon). A few meat dishes also feature on the menu. Definitely the best restaurant in town!
