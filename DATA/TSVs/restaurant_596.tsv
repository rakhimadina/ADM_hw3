Rezzano Cucina e Vino	via Asilo Maria Teresa 34	Sestri Levante	16039	Liguria	Italy	44.2719487	9.3950266	€€€	Seafood, Mediterranean Cuisine	This restaurant is constantly improving and now boasts a comfortable dining room, which has been slightly enlarged thanks to a few adjustments and a reduction in the number of guests allowing for more space between tables. The cuisine pays careful attention to the seasons and to local traditions, with a particular focus on top-quality fish. The small outdoor space in the piazza makes a pleasant setting for dinner.
