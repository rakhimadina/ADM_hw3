Radici	via Mirolte 53	Iseo	25049	Lombardy	Italy	45.6588449	10.0509609	€€€	Italian Contemporary	Situated beneath the walls of Castello Oldofredi in the centre of this delightful lakeside village, not far from the lake itself, this restaurant with a young team at the helm has a light contemporary feel, both in its decor and cuisine. The modern design contrasts with the restaurant’s setting in a historic building, while the dishes are inspired by the recipes and ingredients of the region. Influences from elsewhere in Italy as well as further afield are also in evidence on the menu.
