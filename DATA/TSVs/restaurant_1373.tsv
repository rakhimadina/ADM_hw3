Marechiaro	via Vicenza 14	Bolzano	39100	Trentino-South Tyrol	Italy	46.4940329	11.3416189	€€€	Seafood, Classic Cuisine	This smart, elegant restaurant, which has a particularly romantic ambience in the evening, has been serving top-quality fish in Bolzano for over 20 years. Prepared in traditional Italian style, the dishes here focus on the flavour and quality of the fish and seafood on offer, most of which comes from the Mediterranean. The two friendly brothers who run the restaurant are originally from Naples, which explains the specialities from Campania and the excellent pizza which also features on the menu. A simpler selection of dishes is available at lunchtime.	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	['amex', 'dinersclub', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 0471 402319	http://www.marechiarobolzano.it
