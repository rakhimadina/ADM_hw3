Berton	via Mike Bongiorno 13	Milan	20123	Lombardy	Italy	45.4821805	9.1944159	€€€€	Italian Contemporary, Creative	Situated in the heart of Porta Nuova, this restaurant has one wall made entirely of glass, allowing plenty of daylight to permeate its elegant, contemporary-style dining room which is perfectly in tune with the character of this new, futuristic district. The cuisine here continues to focus on just a few ingredients, so that it is deliberately simple in style without being minimalist. Creative and modern, the dishes are prepared with ingredients from all over Italy with no particular emphasis on any one region: the same is true of the excellent wine list. Professional, attentive and efficient service completes the picture.
