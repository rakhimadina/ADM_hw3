Clemente	piazza Santa Monica	Sulmona	67039	Abruzzo	Italy	42.0507934	13.923711	€€	Cuisine from Abruzzo, Traditional Cuisine	Situated in the charming centre of Sulmona, Clemente has for many years offered guests a simple, welcoming ambience in the restored stables of a palazzo dating from the early 19C. The menu has an exclusive focus on ingredients from the Abruzzi, including home-made pasta “alla chitarra” and the use of saffron from Aquila. The main courses are all meat-based, while among the desserts the Pan dell'Orsosemifreddo is particularly delicious. Although the portions are generous, most of the dishes are also available in half-portions. Aperitifs are served in the bistro-style room.
