Trattoria di Via Serra	via Luigi Serra 9/b	Bologna	40129	Emilia-Romagna	Italy	44.5097151	11.3455818	€	Emilian	It’s well worth heading off the traditional tourist trail to experience this simple and informal trattoria in Bolognina, the city’s historic working-class district which now has a very multicultural feel. Run by a friendly owner, with his talented business partner at the helm in the kitchen, the restaurant boasts a welcoming and friendly ambience that has made it popular, so booking ahead is recommended, even at lunchtime. Top-quality regional cuisine is celebrated here, from fresh pasta (excellent tortellini in broth) to zuppa inglese (a type of trifle).
