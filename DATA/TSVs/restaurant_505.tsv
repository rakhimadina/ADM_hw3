Campo del Drago	Località Castiglion del Bosco	Montalcino	53024	Tuscany	Italy	43.08386	11.422479	€€€€	Contemporary, Tuscan	A certain amount of patience is required to get to this restaurant accessed via a dusty yet attractive dirt track that wends its way through typical Tuscan landscapes. On arrival, you’ll find an enchanting village of medieval origin with a tower and an old, frescoed church, where the Rosewood Castiglion del Bosco (awarded 3 Michelin keys) offers excellent service, splendid guestrooms and one of the best restaurants in the region. Here, chef Matteo Temperini serves some of the most interesting and creative dishes in Tuscany, many of which are prepared using vegetables from the hotel’s own kitchen garden, all showcased on three tasting menus and an à la carte from which a minimum of three courses must be chosen. Dishes are served in an elegant, contemporary-style dining room with a panoramic terrace, while the wine list features over 700 labels with a focus on the region – plenty of Brunellos, plus a particularly noteworthy 2016 Sasso al Sole, also available by the glass.
