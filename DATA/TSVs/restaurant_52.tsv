The entrance leads into an elegant dining room with a maritime decor, followed by a swimming pool, an outdoor dining space and then finally the beach and private beach club. The cuisine has also had a makeover, and now focuses on simple, classic recipes and cooking styles, including a good choice of raw fish and seafood dishes. Specialities include the delicious paccheri pasta with a “trabaccolara” sauce and the addition of king crab, as well as the millefeuille with a raspberry coulis. A simpler menu is available at lunchtime.
