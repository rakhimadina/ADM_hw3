Joia	via Panfilo Castaldi 18	Milan	20124	Lombardy	Italy	45.4772538	9.2016981	€€€€	Vegetarian, Seasonal Cuisine	This restaurant in one of Milan’s historic districts is home to the chef who first introduced the concept of natural, vegetarian cuisine to the world of Italian fine dining. Pietro Leemann is the man (and great philosopher) behind this “vegetarian restaurant” where the menu is 80% vegan and gluten free. This chef’s imaginative and dream-like dishes bear witness to the philosophical and spiritual transformation he has undergone over many years, with recipes that showcase the essence of their ingredients in colour, flavour, texture and presentation. The restaurant is minimalist and elegant in style, while its Joia Academy  aims to introduce participants to all aspects of the chef’s philosophy.
