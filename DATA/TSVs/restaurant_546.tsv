Da Giovanni	via Cortina 1040	Cortina Vecchia	29010	Emilia-Romagna	Italy	44.8731723	9.9243205	€€	Modern Cuisine	The 18C ceramic stove, bright, colourful decor (both period and vintage), long family tradition and excellent cuisine all contribute to making this restaurant which opened half a century ago a bastion of fine cuisine in Piacenza and the wider Po valley. Meat and fish both feature on the menu, although it is the latter that has become renowned as the restaurant’s speciality over the years. The excellent service is friendly and informal yet highly professional, while the extensive wine list also includes a good selection of wines by the glass.
