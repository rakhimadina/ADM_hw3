Sostansa	viale Cossetti 3	Pordenone	33170	Friuli-Venezia Giulia	Italy	45.9580982	12.6608863	€€€	Italian Contemporary, Regional Cuisine	The philosophy of this restaurant of the town centre, situated just outside the traffic-restricted zone, talks about “stories from the kitchen” and “urban” dishes: in other words, it chooses the best market ingredients with an emphasis on (but not exclusive use of) seasonal produce, from which generous, delicious and attractive dishes are created. At lunchtime, there’s a choice of à la carte dishes or a business lunch announced at your table; in the evening, two surprise tasting menus are also available.
