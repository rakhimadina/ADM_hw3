Don Alfonso 1890 San Barbato	SS 93, km 56,300	Lavello	85024	Basilicata	Italy	41.0348692	15.7714997	€€€	Country cooking, Creative	Run by the Iaccarino family, who are renowned for their Mediterranean cuisine at Sant'Agata sui Due Golfi (some of the latter’s dishes feature on the menu here, such as the spaghetto Don Alfonso), this restaurant owes much to its talented chef Donato De Leonardis. His excellent cuisine includes regional influences with a hint of exotic flavour in dishes that are balanced, harmonious and often original without becoming excessively extravagant. We particularly enjoyed the acquerello rice with saltwort, razor clams, green apple and sage, as well as the mullet with pak choi, seafood stew and purple potatoes. The restaurant occupies the first floor of the luxury San Barbato Resort, which has a strong and committed approach to sustainable resource management, and which is also home to three other restaurants, each serving a different type of cuisine.
