Iyo Kaiseki	piazza Alvar Aalto 9N02	Milan	20124	Lombardy	Italy	45.4822057	9.1932579	€€€	Japanese, Sushi	Situated in the heart of the modern Porta Nuova district, where the face of Milan has changed in spectacular and now iconic fashion, this restaurant is situated at the entrance to the Torre Solaria, one of the area’s most famous skyscrapers. Inside, you’ll find one of the city’s most elegant restaurants, where the decor is a modern mix of wood, stone and glass. Here, they serve kaiseki dishes, a faithful version of the most famous type of Japanese cuisine, including some of its most renowned recipes. There’s also a small dining room to one side with a sushi bar and just a few seats, where you can order the surprise omakase menu. The name “Iyo” may seem familiar to you, as the Michelin-starred Iyo (in the Corso Sempione district) also serves Japanese cuisine although it specialises in more creative and fusion-style dishes.
