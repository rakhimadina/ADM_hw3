Silene	Località Pescina 9	Seggiano	58038	Tuscany	Italy	42.9193337	11.5873607	€€€	Tuscan, Modern Cuisine	This authentic family restaurant situated in a quiet mountain village with just a few inhabitants serves delicious home-made cuisine. The owner-chef here delights guests with his decidedly Tuscan dishes full of intense flavours and prepared mainly from produce grown in the restaurant’s kitchen garden. His generous offerings include proverbial recipes such as fried egg with leaves and flowers and his classic pigeon with herbs, all seasoned with olive oil produced on the property from Seggiano olives. Excellent wine list, plus thoughtful recommendations to accompany your meal.
