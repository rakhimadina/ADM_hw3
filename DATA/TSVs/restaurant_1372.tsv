Linfa	piazza Sant'Agostino 19a	San Gimignano	53037	Tuscany	Italy	43.4704034	11.0420787	€€€€	Creative, Country cooking	This small, elegant and attractive restaurant with contemporary works of art on the walls is situated within San Gimignano’s old fortifications yet is easily accessible from the car parks outside the town. Here, chef Vincenzo Martella from Salento serves meat and fish dishes, often casually combining these different ingredients in the same dish (for example, barbecued lamb with peppers and porchetta-style eel). Also well worth sampling is the cuttlefish risotto alla pescatora served as an appetiser and the tortelli maremmani with concentrated apricot and rosehip-infused broth. The wine list is in the capable hands of Cesario Delle Donne, while the choice of using books as a table centrepiece is a nice detail – make sure you admire the book of Tuscan proverbs illustrated by Renato Bellabarba. All in all, a delightful all-round dining experience in one of Tuscany’s real gems.
