La Conchiglia d'Oro	via Nazionale Adriatica nord	Pineto	64025	Abruzzo	Italy	42.6142651	14.0610184	€€	Seafood, Mediterranean Cuisine	The rather anonymous location does not in any way detract from the quality of this historic restaurant, which is renowned for its excellent fish and seafood. The menu showcases fish from the Adriatic cooked using classical techniques with the occasional modern twist, such as in the tuna tartare seasoned with caramelised onions and citrus powder-flavoured mayonnaise. Considering the quality of the fish here, the prices are very reasonable. The beautifully presented desserts are an added bonus.
