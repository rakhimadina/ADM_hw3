Osteria dei Maltagliati	corso Umberto I 36	Torano Nuovo	64010	Abruzzo	Italy	42.8231884	13.7770664	€€	Farm to table, Regional Cuisine	With a very young team led by Maicol and Federica, this rustic restaurant with an exposed-brick decor only opened a few months ago and has already made a name for itself thanks to its fine cuisine. In the dining room, the wood-fired oven and barbecue grill (the latter uses the embers from the former) take centre stage in many of the dishes, so that old, culinary techniques result in delicious cuisine that demonstrates a fine balance of traditional flavours and personalised modern twists. The lamb chops, served with freshly blanched saltwort flavoured with preserved lemon and a light garlic sauce, were truly delicious!
