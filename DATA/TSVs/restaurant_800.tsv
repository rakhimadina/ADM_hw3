Vineria Modì	via Calapitrulli 13	Taormina	98039	Sicily	Italy	37.8525201	15.28835	€€€	Italian Contemporary, Sicilian	Situated in the historic centre of Taormina, just a stone’s throw from Corso dello Struscio and the many brand-name boutiques that have sprung up here in recent years, this restaurant started out as a wine-bar. The passion for wine remains and is evident not only in the extensive, carefully selected wine list, but also in the enthusiasm of its staff. Nowadays, the wine accompanies fine cuisine prepared by the skilful Dalila Grillo, whose brother Ettore oversees the front of house. Guests have the option of two tasting menus or an à la carte (from which a minimum of three courses must be ordered) featuring creative and elaborate dishes with a Sicilian flavour (as well as influences from elsewhere), all served in an elegant dining room. In summer, the outdoor tables overlooking a pedestrianised street are particularly attractive.
