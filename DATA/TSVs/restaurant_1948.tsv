I Tenerumi	via Vulcanello	Isola Vulcano	98055	Sicily	Italy	38.4305495	14.9560516	€€€€	Vegetarian, Creative	We recommend arriving at this restaurant before the sun goes down so that you can enjoy the spectacular sunset in this breathtaking setting with its view of the Aeolian islands. Meanwhile, skilful chef Davide Guidara’s cuisine is just as exciting as the setting, thanks to his single tasting menu prepared in the open-view kitchen. The menu features around twenty small plates prepared by this young and exceptionally talented chef – it’s no surprise that he has already won Michelin’s Best Young Chef award. He enjoys playing with culinary techniques and makes the most of his home-grown produce by using preservation methods such as fermentation, maceration, pickling and salting and then using these preserves along with seasonal ingredients in his dishes. His decidedly personalised cuisine can be paired with original vegetable cocktails (most of which are non-alcoholic), although wine-enthusiasts will be pleased to hear that a wine list is also available. The excellent desserts are prepared by top pastry chef Gianluca Colucci, while the young front-of-house team help to make the evening special with their friendly, attentive service and their ability to put guests immediately at ease. I Tenerumi is a truly unmissable gastronomic experience!
