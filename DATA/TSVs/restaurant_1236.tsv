Otto Geleng	via Teatro Greco 59	Taormina	98039	Sicily	Italy	37.852584	15.290778	€€€€	Mediterranean Cuisine, Sicilian	The elegant atmosphere at this restaurant is typical of Taormina and of Sicily’s old villas, with just eight tables laid out on a terrace adorned with bougainvillea and overlooking Taormina, the Bay of Naxos and Etna. The decor here shows real attention to detail, with an emphasis on the splendour of a grand old residence, while chef Roberto Toro creates typical Sicilian dishes reinterpreted with his own personal twist. His cuisine is showcased on various tasting menus, including a vegetarian option, from which dishes can be chosen à la carte style. We particularly enjoyed the chef’s signature dish, a memorable spaghetti with roast peppers, prawn, sesame and lime which was recommended by the attentive and discreet serving staff, who skilfully manage to put guests at ease in this impressive setting. More than 400 different wines are available to accompany this gourmet journey, with a choice of regional, Italian and French labels, including several excellent wines from small local wineries.
