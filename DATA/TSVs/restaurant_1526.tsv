CUCINA.eat	piazza Galileo Galilei 1	Cagliari	09128	Sardinia	Italy	39.2202729	9.1223668	â‚¬	Modern Cuisine	One of the most interesting restaurants in Cagliari in terms of value for money, with a choice of classic at-table seating or the more informal, convivial option of sitting at the counter. When it comes to choosing your wine, all you need do is look around at the shelves and ask the helpful staff for recommendations. The cuisine focuses on Sardinian recipes and ingredients, as well as more classic options and even experimental dishes that feature new and original combinations. Simpler options are available at lunchtime.
