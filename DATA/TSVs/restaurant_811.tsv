Locanda Sant'Uffizio Enrico Bartolini	strada Sant'Uffizio 1	Cioccaro	14030	Piedmont	Italy	45.0271679	8.2778294	€€€€	Piedmontese, Modern Cuisine	Nestled amid the picturesque hills of the Monferrato region, this restaurant overseen by multi-Michelin-starred Enrico Bartolini sees Gabriele Boffa at the helm in the kitchen, a chef who is young in years but already a real connoisseur of Piedmontese cuisine. With experience in some of the world’s best restaurants behind him, Boffa has accumulated expert knowledge and remarkable technical skills. His cuisine ranges from classic regional dishes interpreted in their purest form – such as his extraordinary agnolotti del plin – to more creative options, which demonstrate a connection with the region, whether in their ingredients or recipes. The setting here is that of an old monastery converted into a smart hotel, with meals served either in an elegant dining room or in the old limonaia (where lemon trees were once stored). The dishes on offer will linger long in the memory, from the generous amuses-bouches to the delicious bread and incredible focaccia, the top-quality meat and much more besides!
