Il Saturnino	via Soprascaro 17	Forio	80075	Campania	Italy	40.7378863	13.8574114	€€	Seafood	It was a love story between an American and a local girl from Forio that led, in 1949, to the opening of this restaurant overlooking the port, with its attractive veranda boasting fine sea views. The current management team have made this one of the most interesting restaurants in the region for anyone keen to sample traditional cuisine from Ischia and Campania. Don’t miss the pasta served with local (and very rare) zampognaro beans, mussels and squid, or the Ischian-style rabbit presented in an attractive terracotta dish. A good choice of fish dishes is also available.	['Great view', 'Terrace']	['amex', 'dinersclub', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 081 998296	http://www.ristorantesaturnino.it
