AlpiNN	Plan de Corones, alt. 2235	Brunico	39031	Trentino-South Tyrol	Italy	46.7384367	11.9557234	€€€	Alpine, Seasonal Cuisine	Situated at an altitude of 2 000m in the Plan de Corones ski area, this restaurant stands next to Lumen, a museum dedicated to mountain photography. To get here, you take the cable-car from Riscone and then, in winter, walk for around 150m through the snow. This impressive project by Norbert Niederkofler, holder of three Michelin stars, showcases the chef’s “Cook the Mountain” philosophy, where a modern approach and Alpine traditions combine to create perfect dishes full of flavour and historic appeal. The memory lingers long after your return back down the mountain (NB: the last cable-car leaves at 5pm!).
