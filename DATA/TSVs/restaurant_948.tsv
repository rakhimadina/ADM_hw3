Il Convito della Venaria	via Andrea Mensa 37/g	Venaria Reale	10078	Piedmont	Italy	45.1351493	7.6258865	€€	Modern Cuisine	This restaurant is run by an enthusiastic couple, with Lucia front of house in the classic and welcoming dining room and Christian at the helm in the kitchen. The menu is lighter (and less expensive) at lunchtime with a wider choice of regional and Italian fare in the evening, plus a few more creative options, including fish dishes. Comfortable guestrooms are also available, two of which have views of the royal palace.	['Terrace']	['amex', 'maestrocard', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 011 459 8392	https://www.ilconvitodellavenaria.it/
