Villa Lattanzi	contrada Cugnolo 19	Torre di Palme	63900	Marche	Italy	43.1376	13.81738	€€€	Italian Contemporary, Modern Cuisine	This gourmet restaurant housed in a restored period residence that once belonged to the counts of Adami is surrounded by the green maquis and hills of the Marche, with the sea visible in the distance just a few miles away. Here, the young Neapolitan chef creates cuisine that is surprising for its attractive, clean lines, providing a real explosion of flavours and a tribute to the region and the Mediterranean in general. The restaurant also owns a nearby agricultural estate which provides many of the wines and olive oils served during tastings.
