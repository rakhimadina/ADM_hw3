Villa Crespi	via Fava 18	Orta San Giulio	28016	Piedmont	Italy	45.7964778	8.4159486	€€€€	Creative, Mediterranean Cuisine	Just a stone’s throw from the enchanting village of Orta San Giulio with its picture-postcard views of the lake and San Giulio island, this three-Michelin-star restaurant boasts a stunning location in a late-19C Moorish-style villa. Impressive both inside and out, this aristocratic residence was once the home of the Crespi family. Today, the villa’s leading light is Antonino Cannavacciuolo, who is now at the helm of a number of Michelin-starred restaurants, of which the Villa Crespi, the most famous and celebrated of them all, is the flagship. Although this chef originally from Vico Equense in Campania takes inspiration from all over Italy and further afield, it is the passion, colour and intense flavours of his native region that shine through in all his dishes. The two tasting menus, as well as the concise à la carte, showcase elegant dishes full of goodness where the focus is on fish and seafood (although meat also features). This is Mediterranean cuisine in all its glory, with a contemporary style that is never forced – typical of Cannavacciuolo at his very best.
