Hostaria del Pavone	via Barbarotta 15/17	Vasto	66054	Abruzzo	Italy	42.1124503	14.710181	€€€	Seafood, Farm to table	A small gem for fish enthusiasts, this delightful restaurant situated amid the alleyways of the historic centre (just 2 minutes’ walk away) boasts a quiet ambience with a white colour scheme and minimalist decor chosen by the exuberant owner. Although the menu focuses on fish and seafood (the raw fish dishes are superb), the pasta dishes and main courses are also excellent. To round off a delightful dining experience, the wine list includes some surprising top-quality labels. A must!
