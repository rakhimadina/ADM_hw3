Il Tiglio	via Isola San Biagio 34	Montemonaco	63088	Marche	Italy	42.9182376	13.316814	€€€	Contemporary, Cuisine from the Marches	It's quite a journey to reach the slopes at the foot of the Sibillini mountains where chef Enrico Mazzaroni’s restaurant is situated, but the effort to get here is more than compensated by the exquisite cuisine on the menu! Although the chef’s great passion is for regional ingredients such as mushrooms, trout, venison and potatoes (much of which is produced at his own agriturismo), his approach is decidedly creative and his recipes highly original. Balanced flavours are to the fore in dishes such as trout and veal with mushrooms thanks to the chef’s technical expertise, while over the years his presentation has become even more photogenic. A successful mix of experience and youth ensures excellent service, which adds to the enjoyable dining experience.
