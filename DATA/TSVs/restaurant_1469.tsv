I Carracci	via Manzoni, 2	Bologna	40121	Emilia-Romagna	Italy	44.4963357	11.3429519	€€€	Classic Cuisine	The ceiling at this restaurant is adorned with superb frescoes thought to be by the school of the Carracci brothers, whose painters were definitely responsible for decorating other rooms in this palazzo. This is one good reason for choosing this restaurant, and the cuisine is another – the new chef here creates dishes which are appealingly creative without being overly fussy or excessive.
