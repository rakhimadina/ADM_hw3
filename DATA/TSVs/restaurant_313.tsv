Il Ciabot	via Costa 7	Roletto	10060	Piedmont	Italy	44.9253944	7.3305602	â‚¬	Piedmontese, Modern Cuisine	Warmed by an open fire in winter, this welcoming family-run restaurant celebrates the cuisine of Piedmont, although a few fish dishes also feature on the menu. Traditional, time-honoured and overlooked dishes take pride of place, such as boiled meat terrine with a salsa verde, Fassone beef in a crust, plus an excellent giandujotto chocolate mousse. Booking ahead is recommended.	['Terrace']	['mastercard', 'visa']	+39 0121 542132	https://www.ristoranteilciabot.it/
