La Bucaccia	via Ghibellina 17	Cortona	52044	Tuscany	Italy	43.2749644	11.9841148	â‚¬	Tuscan	One of the best places to discover Tuscan cuisine, and that of Arezzo in particular, this restaurant serves exquisite dishes full of flavour. Just a few tables are laid out along the main street in the historic centre, while the two interior dining rooms are rustic and romantic in feel. Friendly and exuberant owner Romano merits a particular mention, providing guaranteed entertainment in between courses.
