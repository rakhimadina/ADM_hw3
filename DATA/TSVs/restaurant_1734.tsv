Maré	via Molo di Levante 74	Cesenatico	47042	Emilia-Romagna	Italy	44.2067786	12.4029481	€€€	Seafood, Modern Cuisine	An unexpected gourmet restaurant in a typical private beach club on the Romagna coast, with a dining room that opens on to the beach with its long line of beach umbrellas. The dishes here are carefully prepared and occasionally creative, and all of good quality. We particularly recommend the monfettini (fresh egg pasta) mantecati with cuttlefish, clams, mantis shrimp and ink, which looks like a risotto and is absolutely delicious. The restaurant also boasts a good wine list with an excellent choice of champagnes.
