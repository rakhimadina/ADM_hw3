Materia	via Trieste 1/B	Cernobbio	22012	Lombardy	Italy	45.8383599	9.0685195	€€€	Creative	While this restaurant’s recent move has brought a new setting and a change of address, it continues to serve cuisine which is a fusion of Italian, Asian and other influences, with a menu featuring plenty of vegetables, spices and aromatic herbs used by the chef to create dishes full of concentrated flavours. If you enjoy innovative and original combinations, this is the restaurant for you as many of the dishes on the menu (including the desserts) offer something different, including recipes with more challenging and acidic and bitter flavours. Our inspector particularly enjoyed the pickled whitefish served with roe and bitter local salad leaves. In addition to the à la carte, there’s also a lighter menu available at lunchtime.
