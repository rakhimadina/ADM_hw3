Zum Löwen	via Tirolo 25	Tisens	39010	Trentino-South Tyrol	Italy	46.5635107	11.1694582	€€€	Classic Cuisine, Modern Cuisine	A charming restaurant housed in a skilfully restored old farm, where everything from the hay barn to the old stalls has been refurbished and enhanced, so that traditional old features from the exterior can be seen in the dining room alongside more modern additions. The cuisine here is in the capable hands of owner Anna Matscher, who creates gourmet dishes from the Alto Adige which can by now be described as “classics”. The ingredients and the cooking methods used add a certain level of tradition to proceedings, although this is hardly a flaw, especially given the precise preparation involved. Examples include the traditional roast goat kid cooked with extra-virgin olive oil and aromatic herbs and served with roast potatoes and a second seasonal vegetable, along with its own delicious jus. Luis oversees the front of house and is always available to offer recommendations for the best wine pairings.
