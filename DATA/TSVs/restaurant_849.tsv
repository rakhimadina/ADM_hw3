Gimmi Restaurant	via San Pietro in Lama 23	Lecce	73100	Apulia	Italy	40.3435723	18.1570943	€€€	Contemporary	Despite its location in a Dominican monastery dating from 1442 (also home to a boutique hotel), this restaurant is decidedly modern and minimalist in style, with a light-coloured floor, imposing stone columns, a cross-vaulted ceiling, and a dining room with a view of the glass-fronted wine display. The service here is friendly, attentive and highly efficient, while the top-quality cuisine includes highly recommended specialities such as Capelli d’angelo Benedetto Cavalieri, angel-hair pasta with mantis shrimp, seaweed spaghetti, Galateo saffron, celery and sweet pepper.
