Opera	via Sant'Antonio da Padova 3	Turin	10121	Piedmont	Italy	45.0684854	7.6662476	€€€	Italian Contemporary	The former nineteenth century refectory of the nearby church has become the laboratory of a chef who is as skillful as he is creative: wrapped in the warm atmosphere of the brickwork of the evocative dining room, all the dishes have fruit as a recurring ingredient, which adds a touch of acidity and flavor to dishes of creative cuisine, whether of meat or fish, further enhanced by the work of an excellent sommelier.
