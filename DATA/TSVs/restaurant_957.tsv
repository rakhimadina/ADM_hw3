Paolo e Barbara	via Roma 47	San Remo	18038	Liguria	Italy	43.8148723	7.7738025	€€€€	Country cooking, Contemporary	Paolo and Barbara have been serving excellent cuisine in San Remo since 1987, demonstrating a real passion for local ingredients and regional specialities. This interest has culminated in kitchen gardens that now provide most of the ingredients used in their dishes, including eggs, olive oil and a small amount of wine. Along with top-quality fish, vegetables form the basis of western Liguria’s cuisine, which Paolo combines in his reinterpretations of traditional recipes. His style is showcased in dishes such as cappelletti (a type of egg ravioli) filled with San Remo crayfish and served with a vegetable and Abruzzo saffron broth, an elegant dish that is full of flavour. Barbara oversees the service front of house and provides guests with wine recommendations.
