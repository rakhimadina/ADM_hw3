Per Me Giulio Terrinoni	vicolo del Malpasso 9	Rome	00186	Lazio	Italy	41.8973035	12.46747	€€€€	Italian, Creative	Situated in an alleyway in the historic centre of Rome (a side street off the famous Via Giulia), this restaurant boasts the added attraction of an original and imaginative chef who demonstrates his culinary skills in preparing meat and fish with fine technique and creativity. Sustainability is key here, with a focus on top-quality, carefully chosen ingredients sourced from small-scale local producers, as well as a “zero-waste” approach. In addition to the à la carte, guests can choose from three tasting menus: “Primi Passi” (five of the chef’s iconic dishes), “Testa, Mani, Cuore” (ten dishes with a personal twist), and “Think Green" (five seasonal vegetarian dishes). In summer, be sure to book ahead if you’d like to dine at one of the few tables in the charming outdoor space.
