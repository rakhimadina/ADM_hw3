La Peca	via Alberto Giovanelli 2	Lonigo	36045	Veneto	Italy	45.3848934	11.3990641	€€€€	Modern Cuisine, Contemporary	When you arrive in the upper part of Lonigo and park near the private villa that is home to La Peca, you know that you’ve arrived at one of Italy’s great fine-dining restaurants, where the Portinari family fly the flag for professional, serious cuisine. Once through the large hall on the ground floor (where you’ll find an elegant small lounge for smokers), you make your way to the elegant, warm and contemporary-style dining room on the first floor. In the kitchen, Nicola Portinari transforms seasonal ingredients into creative dishes with influences from the Veneto, proving himself equally skilful with meat and fish alike. The dessert menu deserves a special mention, thanks to its extensive choice (the restaurant has received Michelin’s “Passion dessert” award in 2024) and the combination of imagination and classic techniques. This is showcased in dishes such as the dark chocolate soufflé served with coffee ice cream, apricot and peat whisky. There’s also an interesting wine list overseen by talented sommelier Matteo Bressan.
