Le Due Lanterne	piazza Garibaldi 52	Nizza Monferrato	14049	Piedmont	Italy	44.7731085	8.3531213	â‚¬	Piedmontese, Traditional Cuisine	Situated in the town centre, this typical family-run trattoria is highly popular with locals and offers excellent value for money. Iconic dishes on the menu include rabbit all'Arneis and Piedmontese battuta (a type of beef tartare), while the extensive wine list features a good selection of labels. We recommend booking a table in the first, more comfortable dining room.
