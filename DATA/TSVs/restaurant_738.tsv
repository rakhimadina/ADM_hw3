Despite changing hands in 2020, the restaurant’s essence remains the same. The cuisine is still simple and rustic, generously portioned and full of flavour, with its roots firmly planted in Abruzzi traditions. The menu features arrosticini (skewered grilled meat), vegetable and goat’s cheese fritters, numerous meat-based main courses (mutton, pork, rabbit, wild boar, veal, beef etc), and a white Abruzzese torrone named Oh pe' la Maiellaby the restaurant. Guests are welcome to visit the medieval and Roman remains in the wine cellars.
