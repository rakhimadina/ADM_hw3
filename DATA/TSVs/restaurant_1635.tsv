Oste Scuro - Finsterwirt	vicolo del Duomo 3	Brixen	39042	Trentino-South Tyrol	Italy	46.7157558	11.6565447	€€	Regional Cuisine, Traditional Cuisine	Run by the capable Mayr family, this long-established restaurant has occupied a narrow alleyway in the centre of Bressanone (Brixen) since the late 19C. The dining rooms are decorated in historic style, plus there’s a charming terrace for alfresco dining in summer. Dishes are presented on different tasting menus with the option of choosing traditional or Mediterranean dishes à la carte style – we highly recommend the soup made with Sylvaner wine from the Isarco valley, as well as the Tirtl (fried pie) stuffed with ricotta, spinach and cinnamon. Guestrooms are available in the nearby and recently renovated Adler Historic Guesthouse, which is run by the same owners.
