Almondo Trattoria	piazza Gran Madre di Dio 2/l	Turin	10131	Piedmont	Italy	45.0622509	7.6985608	€€	Italian	This simple yet charming restaurant located just a few metres from the Gran Madre church serves a fine array of regional Italian dishes. Although specialities from Piedmont understandably take pride of place, the menu takes guests on a culinary journey throughout Italy and the changing seasons, featuring dishes such as scialatielli pasta with seafood, Puglian stuffed meat rolls, and zabaglione with traditional hazelnut cake from the Langhe. There’s also a good selection of gluten-free options.	['Air conditioning', 'Terrace']	['amex', 'mastercard', 'visa']	+39 011 411 9684	http://www.almondotrattoria.it
