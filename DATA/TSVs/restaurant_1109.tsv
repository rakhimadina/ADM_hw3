Hostaria Viola	via Verdi 32	Castiglione delle Stiviere	46043	Lombardy	Italy	45.3801999	10.5092241	€€	Mantuan, Lombardian	Having run this simple yet welcoming restaurant for over 100 years, it’s no surprise that the family at the helm here are true connoisseurs of Mantuan culinary traditions! The menu pays tribute to the delicious cuisine of Mantova featuring a host of celebrated and lesser-known specialities, including sorbir (filled pasta in broth), excellent cured hams, pike seasoned with a Mantuan sauce (made from anchovies and capers) served with polenta or mashed potatoes and, to finish, the renowned sbrisolona cake or zabaglione ice cream. There are so many specialities, you won’t be disappointed!
